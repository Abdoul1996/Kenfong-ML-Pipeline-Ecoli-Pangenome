# Mills 2022


## Data Summary 
* 
- There are 2,076 samples included
- `mills_metadata.tsv`: a tab-separated file containing all the assemblies associated with BioProject PRJNA809394. Includes assembly name, sequence length, and more.  
- `mills_assembly_accession.txt`: a text file containing the accessions of each assembly in the dataset.
- `roary_output/*`: a directory containing files from running roary on all of the accessions. It includes:
  - `pan_genome_reference.fa`
  - `summary_statistics.txt`
  - core_gene_alignment.aln has been omitted from the github due to the size of the file (4.0G), but is included on the server in the directory `/home/922347787/Myco/git-repos/Kenfong_Ecoli_ML/kenfong2024/dataset_folder/mills_2022/roary-output`
  - gene_presence_absence.csv and .rtab have been ommitted as well because they also are too big for github.
