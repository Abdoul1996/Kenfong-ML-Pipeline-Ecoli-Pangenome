The objective of these datasets is to predict susceptibility (S) or resistance (R) in E.coli Bacteria for several drugs using different machine learning algorithms. The dataset consists of three datasets which are metadata, gene presence and absence, and population structures. Ultimately, these three datasets are combined into a single dataframe to use the different machine learning algorithms.

## Data Summary 
* Year was collected from patient 2018
* metadata (Year of isolation) :(1936, 14)
