# Gladstone 2021 README
This repository contains data from a nationwide, longitudinal study investigating antimicrobial resistance in Escherichia coli isolates collected in Norway between 2002 and 2017. The data originates from the Norwegian surveillance programme on resistant microbes (NORM).

## Data Summary:
* Source: Norwegian surveillance programme on resistant microbes (NORM)
* Years: 2002-2017
* Isolates: 22,512 E. coli isolates original collection, 3,500 E. coli isolates sampled
* Features available:
 - Sample identifier (accession number)
 - Laboratory
 - Year of collection
 - Sample collection date (may not be available for all isolates)
 - Antimicrobial susceptibility profile (ASP or SIR, susceptibility, inhibition, resistance)

## Antibiotics Drug with SIR info
* Ampicillin, Aztreonam, Cefotaxim, Ceftazidim, Cefuroxim, Ciprofloxacin, Gentamicin, Meropenem, Nalidixin, Piperacillin, Sulfa, Tigecyklin, Tobramycin, Trimethoprim


## Data Source:
The data was obtained from the original collection maintained by NORM. We included the first 22.5% of isolates collected annually from 15 out of the 22 participating laboratories in NORM, due to limitations in sequencing capacity (3500 isolates). https://www.thelancet.com/cms/10.1016/S2666-5247(21)00031-8/attachment/32b3fc53-14f6-4af2-9fb7-0f08362e352a/mmc2.xlsx
